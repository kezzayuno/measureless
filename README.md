# Measureless: The No Measurements Recipe Website

## Description

We have all come across wanting to learn a new recipe. For me, I remember Googling for a basic cream pasta and for some strange reason, I was given a whole life story plus precise measurements. I thought, "Dude, why do I have to scroll through a novel before I can get to the recipe steps?" No Measurements is a website dedicated to using no measurements and no novels. I grew up thinking that cooking is a skill that hones not only your knife skills but also your sense of taste and cooking intuition. Nowadays, I do not reach for my measuring cups and trust my judgment. If you shape similar thoughts, this is a website for you. 

## TLDR;

- Recipes with no measurments 
- Strict format to avoid novels to made (It's great that this recipe was passed down through generations, but man, I just wanna eat.)
- Train your sense of taste (Let taste be your guide!)
